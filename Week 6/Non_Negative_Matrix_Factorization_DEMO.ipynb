It is widely used for feature extraction and unsupervised learning tasks. More specifically, given a non-negative data matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ with non-negative entries, $\\color{lightblue}{\\text{NMF}}$ aims to find two non-negative matrices, $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times r}$ and $H \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times n}$, such that:\n","\n","$$ X \\approx WH $$\n","\n","where:\n","- $r$ is the reduced rank or the number of components used to represent the data.\n","- $W$ is the non-negative basis matrix that represents the features or components of the data.\n","- $H$ is the non-negative coefficient matrix that encodes how much each component contributes to each data point.\n","\n","The objective of $\\color{lightblue}{\\text{NMF}}$ is to minimize the reconstruction error between $X$ and its approximation $WH$, subject to the constraint that all entries of $W$ and $H$ are non-negative.\n","\n","$(1)$ **Objective Function:**\n","\n","The objective function of $\\color{lightblue}{\\text{NMF}}$ is typically formulated as the Frobenius norm of the reconstruction error:\n","\n","$$ \\underset{W, \\ H}{Min} \\ \\frac{1}{2} \\| X - WH \\|_{F}^{2} $$\n","\n","where $\\| \\cdot \\|_{F}$ denotes the Frobenius norm, which is the square root of the sum of squared elements of a matrix.\n","\n","$(2)$ **Non-Negativity Constraints:**\n","\n","The non-negativity constraints in $\\color{lightblue}{\\text{NMF}}$ require that all elements of $W$ and $H$ are non-negative:\n","\n","$$ W \\geq 0, \\quad H \\geq 0 $$\n","\n","This constraint ensures that the components and coefficients are additive and interpretable.\n","\n","$(3)$ **Optimization:**\n","\n","To find the optimal values of $W$ and $H$, various optimization algorithms can be used. One common approach is multiplicative update rules, which iteratively updates $W$ and $H$ to minimize the objective function while enforcing the non-negativity constraints. The multiplicative update rules are as follows:\n","\n","$$W_{ik} \\leftarrow W_{ik} \\frac{(XH^T)_{ik}}{(WHH^T)_{ik}}$$\n","\n","$$H_{kj} \\leftarrow H_{kj} \\frac{(W^TX)_{kj}}{(W^TWH)_{kj}}$$\n","\n","where $(\\cdot)_{ik}$ denotes the element at the $i$-th row and $k$-th column of the matrix, and $(\\cdot)^T$ denotes the transpose.\n","\n","$(4)$ **Initialization:**\n","\n","$\\color{lightblue}{\\text{NMF}}$ is sensitive to initialization, and different initial values for $W$ and $H$ may result in different solutions. Common initialization strategies include random initialization and using other techniques such as $\\color{lightgreen}{\\text{singular value decomposition (SVD)}}$.\n","\n","$(5)$ **Termination:**\n","\n","The optimization process continues iteratively until convergence criteria are met. Convergence can be determined based on the number of iterations, the relative change in the objective function, or other stopping criteria.\n","\n","$(6)$ **Interpretation:**\n","\n","Once the optimization converges, the matrices $W$ and $H$ represent the low-dimensional feature representations and coefficients, respectively. These components and coefficients can be interpreted to understand the underlying structure and patterns in the data.\n","\n","In summary, $\\color{lightblue}{\\text{Non-Negative Matrix Factorization}}$ is a dimensionality reduction technique that factors a non-negative data matrix into two non-negative matrices, representing features and coefficients. By enforcing non-negativity constraints, $\\color{lightblue}{\\text{NMF}}$ generates interpretable and additive components, making it useful for feature extraction and pattern discovery in various applications."],"metadata":{"id":"O29mGPYU5oj8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["$ \\ $\n","\n","-----\n","\n","## ***Installing required libraries***\n","\n","$ \\ $\n","\n","\n","The following required modules are pre-installed in the Skills Network Labs environment."],"metadata":{"id":"rM46caDQDVKY"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from scipy.sparse import coo_matrix\n","from sklearn.decomposition import NMF"],"metadata":{"id":"fpvQpA4uDWot","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1690497679377,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1767,"user":{"displayName":"Julian Uribe Castaneda","userId":"01100800522262133421"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Surpress numpy data type warnings\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category = DeprecationWarning)\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category = UserWarning)\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category = RuntimeWarning)\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category = FutureWarning)"],"metadata":{"id":"xXywKs8aDlHw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1690497679378,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Julian Uribe Castaneda","userId":"01100800522262133421"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Ajustamos el contexto de los gráficos a 'notebook'.\n","sns.set_context('notebook')\n","\n","# Ajustamos el estilo de los gráficos a 'white'.\n","sns.set_style('white')"],"metadata":{"id":"JKtsLRfUDnO-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1690497679378,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Julian Uribe Castaneda","userId":"01100800522262133421"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["$ \\ $\n","\n","----\n","\n","## ***Data (BBC dataset)***\n","\n","$ \\ $\n","\n","We will be using the BBC dataset.
